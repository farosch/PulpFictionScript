		<p class="spoken">No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- but you forget about it in a day or two -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days ofme rememberin' have just begun.</p>
		<p class="spoken">When you go on like this, you know what you sound like?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You sound like a duck.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack...</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. Because since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again.</p>
		<p class="spoken">After tonight.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Correct. I got all tonight to quack.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Can I get anybody anymore coffee?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oh yes, thank you.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm doin' fine.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are easier! Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. They're insured, why should they care? You don't even need a gun in a federal bank. I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: "We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all yourmoney, we're gonna kill 'er."</p>
		<p class="spoken">Did it work?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about! Knucklehead walks i na bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Did they hurt the little girl?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't know. There probably never was a little girl - the point of thestory isn't the little girl. The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You wanna rob banks?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what webeen doin'.</p>
		<p class="spoken">So you don't want to be a bank robber?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin'twenty.</p>
		<p class="spoken">And no more liquor stores?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What have we been talking about? Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: "Empty out the register", and they don't know what it fuckin' means. They make it too personal. We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm not gonna kill anybody.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them. Andif it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, what else is there, day jobs?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Not this life.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well what then?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Garcon! Coffee!</p>
		<p class="spoken">This place.</p>
		<p class="spoken">"Garcon" means boy.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Here? It's a coffee shop.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's wrong with that? People never rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Correct. Just like banks, these places are insured. The managers don't givea fuck, they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners. Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register. Busboys, some wetbackgettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner. Customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin'on. One minute they're havin' a Denver omelet, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face.</p>
		<p class="spoken">See, I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. 'Member all those customers kept comin' in?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Then you got the idea to take everybody's wallet.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Uh-huh.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That was a good idea.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Thanks.</p>
		<p class="spoken">We made more from the wallets then we did the register.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes we did.</p>
		<p class="spoken">A lot of people go to restaurants.</p>
		<p class="spoken">A lot of wallets.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Pretty smart, huh?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Pretty smart.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm ready, let's go, right here, right now.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Remember, same as before, you're crowd control, I handle the employees.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Got it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I love you, Pumpkin.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I love you, Honey Bunny.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Everybody be cool this is a robbery!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers! Got that?</p>
		<p class="spoken">- Okay now, tell me about the hashbars?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What so you want to know?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, hash is legal there, right?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean youcan't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. You're only supposed to smoke in your homeor certain designated places.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Those are hash bars?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause - get a load of this - if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That did it, man - I'm fuckin' goin', that's all there is to it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You'll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they're a little different.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Examples?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don't meanin a paper cup either. They give yo a glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?</p>
		<p class="spoken">They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What'd they call it?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Royale with Cheese.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King. But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Mayonnaise.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Goddamn!</p>
		<p class="spoken">I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Uuccch!</p>
		<p class="spoken">We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.</p>
		<p class="spoken">How many up there?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Three or four.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Counting our guy?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm not sure.</p>
		<p class="spoken">So there could be five guys up there?</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's possible.</p>
		<p class="spoken">We should have fuckin' shotguns.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's her name?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Mia.</p>
		<p class="spoken">How did Marsellus and her meet?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I dunno, however people meet people. She usta be an actress.</p>
		<p class="spoken">She ever do anything I woulda saw?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's a pilot?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, you know the shows on TV?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't watch TV.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes, but you're aware that there's an invention called television, and on that invention they show shows?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot. And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get accepted and become TV programs, and some don't, and become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-</p>
		<p class="spoken">black, half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky Horror.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah maybe, fat right?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat. He's got a weight problem. What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I think I know who you mean, what about him?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good. And word around the campfire, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What'd he do, fuck her?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No no no no no no no, nothin' that bad.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well what then?</p>
		<p class="spoken">He gave her a foot massage.</p>
		<p class="spoken">A foot massage?</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's all?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What did Marsellus do?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sent a couple of guys over to his place. They took him out on the patio of his apartment, threw his ass over the balcony. Nigger fell four stories. They had this garden at the bottom, enclosed in glass, like one of them greenhouses - nigger fell through that. Since then, he's kinda developed a speech impediment.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's a damn shame.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Still I hafta say, play with matches, ya get burned.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Whaddya mean?</p>
		<p class="spoken">You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You don't think he overreacted?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction.</p>
		<p class="spoken">It was a foot massage, a foot massage is nothing, I give my mother a foot massage.</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's laying hands on Marsellus Wallace's new wife in a familiar way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out- no, but you're in the same fuckin' ballpark.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right there. Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Not the same thing, the same ballpark.</p>
		<p class="spoken">It ain't no ballpark either. Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Foot massages don't mean shit.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Have you ever given a foot massage?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Don't be tellin' me about foot massages - I'm the foot fuckin' master.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Given a lot of 'em?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Shit yeah. I got my technique down man, I don't tickle or nothin'.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Have you ever given a guy a foot massage?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Fuck you.</p>
		<p class="spoken">How many?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Fuck you.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Would you give me a foot massage - I'm kinda tired.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' pissed - this is the door.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What time is it?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Seven-twenty-two in the morning.</p>
		<p class="spoken">It ain't quite time, let's hang back.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Look, just because I wouldn't give no man a foot massage, don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass-motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. That ain't right, man. Motherfucker do that to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'd kill'a motherfucker.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm not sayin' he was right, but you're sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'. We act like they don't, but they do. That's what's so fuckin' cool about 'em. This sensual thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan shoulda known fuckin' better. That's his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna have a sense of humor about that shit.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's an interesting point, but let's get into character.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's her name again?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Mia. Why you so interested in big man's wife?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida and when he's gone, he wants me to take care of Mia.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Take care of her?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Not that! Take her out. Show her agood time. Don't let her get lonely.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?</p>
		<p class="spoken">It ain't a date. It's like when you and your buddy's wife go to a movie or somethin'. It's just... you know... good company.</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's not a date.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hey kids.</p>
		<p class="spoken">How you boys doin'?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Am I trippin', or did I just ask you a question.</p>
		<p class="spoken">We're doin' okay.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Do you know who we are?</p>
		<p class="spoken">We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace, you remember your business partner dont'ya?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: you're Brett, right?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm Brett.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I thought so. Well, you remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, dont'ya Brett?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I remember him.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Good for you. Looks like me and Vincent caught you at breakfast, sorry 'bout that. What'cha eatin'?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hamburgers.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast. What kinda hamburgers?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Cheeseburgers.</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, I mean where did you get'em?</p>
		<p class="spoken">MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box, where?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Big Kahuna Burger.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Big Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself, how are they?</p>
		<p class="spoken">They're good.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Mind if I try one of yours?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yours is this one, right?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna Burger?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You wanna bite, they're real good.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I ain't hungry.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, if you like hamburgers give'em a try some time. Me, I can't usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian. Which more or less makes me a vegetarian, but I sure love the taste of a good burger.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Tell 'em, Vincent.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Royale with Cheese.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Royale with Cheese, you know why they call it that?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Because of the metric system?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Check out the big brain on Brett. You'a smart motherfucker, that's right. The metric system.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's in this?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sprite.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sprite, good, mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sure.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!</p>
		<p class="spoken">You, Flock of Seagulls, you know what we're here for?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Then why don't you tell my boy here Vince, where you got the shit hid.</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's under the be -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- I don't remember askin' you a goddamn thing.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You were sayin'?</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's under the bed.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Got it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">We happy?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Vincent!</p>
		<p class="spoken">We happy?</p>
		<p class="spoken">We're happy.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Look, what's your name? I got his name's Vincent, but what's yours?</p>
		<p class="spoken">My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' your ass outta this shit.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I just want you to know how sorry weare about how fucked up things got between us and Mr. Wallace. When we entered into this thing, we only had the best intentions -</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your concentration? I didn't mean to do that. Please, continue. I believe you were saying something about "best intentions".</p>
		<p class="spoken">Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through anyway. Well, let me retort. Would you describe for me what Marsellus Wallace looks like?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What country you from!</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="spoken">"What" ain't no country I know! Do they speak English in "What?"</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="spoken">English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-it?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Then you understand what I'm sayin'?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now describe what Marsellus Wallacelooks like!</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What" again! I dare ya, I double dare ya motherfucker, say "What" one more goddamn time!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now describe to me what Marsellus Wallace looks like!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well he's... he's... black -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- go on!</p>
		<p class="spoken">... and he's... he's... bald -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- does he look like a bitch?!</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!</p>
		<p class="spoken">No.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Then why did you try to fuck 'im like a bitch?!</p>
		<p class="spoken">I didn't.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 'im. You ever read the Bible, Brett?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes.</p>
		<p class="spoken">There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I willstrike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."</p>
		<p class="spoken">I think you're gonna find - when all this shit is over and done - I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right now you got ability. But painful as it may be, ability don't last. Now that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life, but it's a fact of life your ass is gonna hafta git realistic about. This business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers who thought their ass aged like wine. Besides, even if you went all the way, what would you be? Feather-weight champion of the world. Who gives a shit? I doubt youcan even get a credit card based onthat.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now the night of the fight, you may fell a slight sting, that's pride fuckin' wit ya. Fuck pride! Pride only hurts, it never helps. Fight through that shit. 'Cause a year from now, when you're kickin' it in the Caribbean you're gonna say, "Marsellus Wallace was right".</p>
		<p class="spoken">I got no problem with that.</p>
		<p class="spoken">In the fifth, your ass goes down.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Say it!</p>
		<p class="spoken">In the fifth, my ass goes down.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, git your ass on in here.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Where's the big man?</p>
		<p class="spoken">He's over there, finishing up some business.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hang back for a second or two, and when you see the white boy leave, go on over. In the meanwhile, can I make you an espresso?</p>
		<p class="spoken">How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' American?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia out tomorrow?</p>
		<p class="spoken">At Marsellus' request.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Have you met Mia?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Not yet.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's so funny?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Not a goddamn thing.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit across a table, chew my food with my mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and that's all I'm gonna do.</p>
		<p class="spoken">My name's Paul, and this is betweeny'all.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Filters?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Non.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Lookin' at somethin', friend?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I ain't your friend, palooka.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What was that?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Vincent Vega has entered the building, git your ass over here!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.</p>
		<p class="spoken">... I'll lend it to you. It's a great book on body piercing.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You know how they use that gun when they pierce your ears? They don't use that when they pierce your nipples, do they?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Forget that gun. That gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing. All of my piercing, sixteen places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle. Five in each ear. One through the nipple on my left breast. One through my right nostril. One through my left eyebrow. One through my lip. One in my clit. And I wear a stud in my tongue.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm curious, why would you get a stud in your tongue?</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Vince, you can come in now!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very good stuff. This is Bava, different, but equally good. And this is Choco from the Hartz Mountains of Germany. Now the first two are the same, forty-</p>
		<p class="spoken">five an ounce - those are friend prices - but this one...</p>
		<p class="spoken">... this one's a little more expensive. It's fifty-five. But when you shoot it, you'll know where that extra money went. Nothing wrong with the first two. It's real, real, real, good shit. But this one's a fuckin' madman.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood? No. You're in my house. White people who know the difference between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to. My shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit any ol' day of the fuckin' week.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's a bold statement.</p>
		<p class="spoken">This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is a seller's market. Coke is fuckin' dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin, they're as hot as hell.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Give me three hundred worth of the madman. If it's as good as you say, I'll be back for a thousand.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I just hope I still have it. Whaddya think of Trudi? She ain't got a boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get high?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Which one's Trudi? The one with all the shit in her face?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, that's Jody. That's my wife.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm on my way somewhere. I got a dinner engagement. Rain check?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No problem?</p>
		<p class="spoken">You don't mind if I shoot up here?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Me casa, su casa.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Mucho gracias.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Still got your Malibu?</p>
		<p class="spoken">You know what some fucker did to it the other day?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Fuckin' keyed it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oh man, that's fucked up.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Tell me about it. I had the goddamn thing in storage three years. It's out five fuckin' days - five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucks  with it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">They should be fuckin' killed. No trial, no jury, straight to execution.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I just wish I caught 'em doin' it, ya know? Oh man, I'd give anything to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been worth his doin' it, if I coulda just caught 'em, you know what I mean?</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's chicken shit. You don't fuck another man's vehicle.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside and make yourself a drink.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hello?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Vincent.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Vincent. I'm on the intercom.</p>

		<p class="spoken">To your right.</p>
		<p class="spoken">... warm. Warmer. Disco.</p>

		<p class="spoken">The bar's by the fireplace.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Okay.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Let's go.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What the fuck is this place?</p>
		<p class="spoken">This is Jack rabbit Slim's. An Elvis man should love it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You can get a steak here, daddy-o. Don't be a...</p>
		<p class="spoken">After you, kitty-cat.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.</p>
		<p class="spoken">How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, or bloody as hell?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Bloody as hell. And to drink, a vanilla coke.</p>
		<p class="spoken">How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger -bloody- and a five-dollar shake.</p>
		<p class="spoken">How d'ya want that shake, Martin and Lewis, or Amos and Andy?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Martin and Lewis.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Did you just order a five-dollar shake?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sure did.</p>
		<p class="spoken">A shake? Milk and ice cream?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Uh-huh.</p>
		<p class="spoken">It costs five dollars?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yep.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You don't put bourbon in it or anything?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Nope.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Just checking.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Whaddya think?</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's like a wax museum with a pulse rate.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What are you doing?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Rollin' a smoke.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Here?</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's just tobacco.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oh. Well in that case, will you roll me one, cowboy?</p>
		<p class="spoken">You can have this one, cowgirl.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Thanks.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Think nothing of it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That was my fifteen minutes.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What was it?</p>
		<p class="spoken">It was show about a team of female secret agents called "Fox Force Five".</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="spoken">"Fox Force Five". Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with. Five, as in there's one... two ... three... four... five of us. There was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal from that show "Baton Rouge", she was the leader. A Japanese one, a black one, a French one and a brunette one, me. We all had special skills. Sommerset had a photographic memory, the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the French fox' specialty was sex...</p>
		<p class="spoken">What was your specialty?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Knives. The character I played, Raven McCoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. So she grew up doing a knife act. According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife. But because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat. She could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist - when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy. And she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. If we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode I woulda told and ol joke.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Do you remember any of the jokes?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well I only got the chance to say one, 'cause we only did one show.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Tell me.</p>
		<p class="spoken">No. It's really corny.</p>
		<p class="spoken">C'mon, don't be that way.</p>
		<p class="spoken">No. You won't like it and I'll be embarrassed.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You told it in front of fifty million people and you can't tell it to me? I promise I won't laugh.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's what I'm afraid of.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's not what I meant and you knowit.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You're quite the silver tongue devil, aren't you?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's not what you said Vince. Well now I'm definitely not gonna tell ya, 'cause it's been built up too much.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What a gyp.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yummy!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Can I have a sip of that? I'd like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Be my guest.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You can use my straw, I don't have kooties.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah, but maybe I do.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Kooties I can handle.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Told ya.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't know if it's worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Don't you hate that?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't know.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's when you know you found somebody special. When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't think we're there yet. But don't feel bad, we just met eachother.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to the bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something to say.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'll do that.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I said goddamn!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Don't you love it when you go to the bathroom and you come back to find your food waiting for you?</p>
		<p class="spoken">We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy Holly doesn't seem to be much of a waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Which one, there's two Marilyn Monroes.</p>
		<p class="spoken">No there's not.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's Marilyn Monroe...</p>
		<p class="spoken">... and that's Mamie Van Doren. Idon't see Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her night off.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Pretty smart.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I have moments.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Did ya think of something to say?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Actually, there's something I've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and I didn't want to offend you.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting-to-know-</p>
		<p class="spoken">you chit-chat. This sounds like you actually have something to say.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Only if you promise not to get offended.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You can't promise something like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask. You could ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended. Then, through no fault of my own, I woulda broken my promise.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Then let's just forget it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That is an impossibility. Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Is that a fact?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Besides, it's more exciting when you don't have permission.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What do you think about what happened to Antwan?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Who's Antwan?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Tony Rocky Horror.</p>
		<p class="spoken">He fell out of a window.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's one way to say it. Another way is, he was thrown out. Anotherway is, he was thrown out by Marsellus. And even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Is that a fact?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No it's not, it's just what I heard.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Who told you this?</p>
		<p class="spoken">They.</p>
		<p class="spoken">They talk a lot, don't they?</p>
		<p class="spoken">They certainly do.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well don't by shy Vincent, what exactly did they say?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Let me help you Bashful, did it involve the F-word?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No. They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage.</p>
		<p class="spoken">And... ?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No and, that's it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horrorout of a four-story window because he massaged my feet?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah.</p>
		<p class="spoken">And you believed that?</p>
		<p class="spoken">At the time I was told, it seemed reasonable.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you.</p>
		<p class="spoken">A husband being protective of his wife is one thing. A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.</p>
		<p class="spoken">But did it happen?</p>
		<p class="spoken">The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan once - at my wedding- then never again. The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror. But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment you've all been waiting for, the worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.</p>
		<p class="spoken">... One lucky couple will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding.</p>
		<p class="spoken">... Now, who will be our first contestants?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Right here.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I wanna dance.</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss, told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted, Now, I want to dance. I want to win. I want that trophy.</p>
		<p class="spoken">All right.</p>
		<p class="spoken">So, dance good.</p>
		<p class="spoken">All right, you asked for it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Let's hear it for our first contestants.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening. Young lady, what is your name?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Missus Mia Wallace.</p>
		<p class="spoken">And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Vincent Vega.</p>
		<p class="spoken">All right, let's see what you can do. Take it away!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Was than an uncomfortable silence?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't know what that was.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Music and drinks!</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm gonna take a piss.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That was a little bit more information than I needed to know, but go right ahead.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, you've been holding out on me.</p>
		<p class="spoken">One drink and leave. Don't be rude, but drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get inyour car, and go down the road.</p>
		<p class="spoken">... It's a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty. Because when people are loyal to each other, that's very meaningful.</p>
		<p class="spoken">So you're gonna go out there, drink your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had a very lovely evening", go home, and jack off. And that's all you're gonna do.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Jesus Christ!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer me honey, what did you take?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Okay honey, we're getting you on your feet.</p>
		<p class="spoken">We're on our feet now, and now we're gonna talk out to the car. Here we go, watch us walk.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hold hands, you love birds.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Lance! The phone's ringing!</p>
		<p class="spoken">I can hear it!</p>
		<p class="spoken">I thought you told those fuckin' assholes never to call this late!</p>
		<p class="spoken">I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna tell this fuckin' asshole right now!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hello, do you know how late it is? You're not supposed to be callin' me this fuckin' late.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way to your place.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Whoa, hold you horses man, what's the problem?</p>
		<p class="spoken">You still got an adrenaline shot?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Maybe.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I need it man, I got a chick she's fuckin' ODing on me.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Don't bring her here! I'm not even fuckin' joking with you, don't you be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt to my house!</p>
		<p class="spoken">No choice.</p>
		<p class="spoken">She's ODin'?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah. She's dyin'.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take 'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Negative.</p>
		<p class="spoken">She ain't my fuckin' problem, you fucked her up, you deal with it -are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sorry.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't know you, who is this, don't come here, I'm hangin' up.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Too late, I'm already here.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What the hell was that?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Have you lost your mind?! You crashed your car in my fuckin' house! You talk about drug shit on a cellular fuckin' phone -</p>
		<p class="spoken">If you're through havin' your little hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get your needle and git it now!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Are you deaf? You're not bringin' that fucked up bitch in my house!</p>
		<p class="spoken">This fucked up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But before he turns me into a bar soap, I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about how you coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your frontlawn.</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's only one-thirty in the goddamn mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on out here?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Who's she?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Get that black box in the bedroom I have with the adrenaline shot.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's wrong with her?</p>
		<p class="spoken">She's ODing on us.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well get her the hell outta here!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Get the fuckin' shot!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Don't yell and me!</p>
		<p class="spoken">You two are a match made in heaven.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay?</p>
		<p class="spoken">While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta get a medical book.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What do you need a medical book for?</p>
		<p class="spoken">To tell me how to do it. I've never given an adrenaline shot before.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You've had that thing for six years and you never used it?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I never had to use it. I don't go joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all of my friends can handle their highs!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well then get it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I am, if you'll let me.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin' to her.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hurry up man! We're losin' her!</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm looking as fast as I can!</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's he lookin' for?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I dunno, some medical book.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What are you lookin' for?</p>
		<p class="spoken">My black medical book!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Whata're you looking for?</p>
		<p class="spoken">My black fuckin' medical book. It's like a text book they give to nurses.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I never saw a medical book.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Trust me, I have one.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well if it's that important, why didn't you keep it with the shot?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't know! Stop bothering me!</p>
		<p class="spoken">While you're lookin' for it, that girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're never gonna find it in all this shit. For six months now, I've been telling you to clean this room -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- get your ass in here, fuck the book!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Quit fuckin' around man and give her the shot!</p>
		<p class="spoken">While I'm doing this, take her shirt off and find her heart.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Does it have to be exact?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving her an injection in the heart, so I gotta exactly hit her in the heart.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, I don't know exactly where her heart is, I think it's here.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I need a big fat magic marker, got one?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I need a big fat magic marker, any felt pen'll do, but a magic markerwould be great.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hold on.</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's ready, I'll tell you what to do.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You're gonna give her the shot.</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, you're gonna give her the shot.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I've never does this before.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I've never done this before either, and I ain't starting now. You brought 'er here, that means you give her the shot. The day I bring an ODing bitch to your place, then I gotta give her the shot.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Got it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Okay, what do I do?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, you're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart. But she's got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that. So what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I gotta stab her?</p>
		<p class="spoken">If you want the needle to pierce through to her heart, you gotta stab her hard.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What happens after that?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm curious about that myself.</p>
		<p class="spoken">This ain't a fuckin' joke man!</p>
		<p class="spoken">She's supposed to come out of it like -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- that.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Count to three.</p>
		<p class="spoken">One...</p>
		<p class="spoken">... two...</p>
		<p class="spoken">... three!</p>
		<p class="spoken">If you're okay, say something.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Something.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Anybody want a beer?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Mia!</p>
		<p class="spoken">What are your thoughts on how to handle this?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's yours?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus can live his whole live and never ever hear of this incident.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Don't worry about it. If Marsellus ever heard of this, I'd be in as much trouble as you.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I seriously doubt that.</p>
		<p class="spoken">If you can keep a secret, so can I.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Let's shake on it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Mum's the word.</p>
		<p class="spoken">If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home and have a heart attack.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCEFIVE" joke?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sure, but I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's not funny. But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I can't wait.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Three tomatoes are walking down the street, a poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato. The baby tomato is lagging behind the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa tomato gets mad, goes over to the momma tomato and stamps on him -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- and says: catch up.</p>
		<p class="spoken">See ya 'round, Vince.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Butch.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Butch, stop watching TV a second. We got a special visitor. Now do you remember when I told you your daddy dies in a P.O.W. camp?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Uh-huh.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well this here is Capt. Koons. He was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hello, little man. Boy I sure hearda bunch about you. See, I was a goodfriend of your Daddy's. We were inthat Hanoi pit of hell over fiveyears together. Hopefully, you'llnever have to experience thisyourself, but when two men are in asituation like me and your Daddywere, for as long as we were, youtake on certain responsibilities ofthe other. If it had been me who hadnot made it, Major Coolidge would betalkin' right now to my son Jim. Butthe way it worked out is I'm talkin'to you, Butch. I got somethin' forya.</p>
		<p class="spoken">This watch I got here was firstpurchased by your great-granddaddy. It was bought during the First WorldWar in a little general store inKnoxville, Tennessee. It was boughtby private Doughboy Ernie Coolidgethe day he set sail for Paris. Itwas your great-granddaddy's war watch, made by the first company to evermake wrist watches. You see, up untilthen, people just carried pocketwatches. Your great-granddaddy worethat watch every day he was in thewar. Then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great-</p>
		<p class="spoken">grandmother, took the watch off hiswrist and put it in an ol' coffeecan. And in that can it stayed 'tilyour grandfather Dane Coolidge wascalled upon by his country to gooverseas and fight the Germans onceagain. This time they called it WorldWar Two. Your great-granddaddy gaveit to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't asgood as his old man's. Your granddadwas a Marine and he was killed withall the other Marines at the battleof Wake Island. Your granddad wasfacing death and he knew it. None ofthose boys had any illusions aboutever leavin' that island alive. Sothree days before the Japanese tookthe island, your 22-year oldgrandfather asked a gunner on an AirForce transport named Winocki, a manhe had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who hehad never seen in the flesh, hisgold watch. Three days later, yourgrandfather was dead. But Winockikept his word. After the war wasover, he paid a visit to yourgrandmother, delivering to your infantfather, his Dad's gold watch. Thiswatch. This watch was on your Daddy'swrist when he was shot down overHanoi. He was captured and put in aVietnamese prison camp. Now he knewif the gooks ever saw the watch it'dbe confiscated. The way your Daddylooked at it, that watch was yourbirthright. And he'd be damned ifand slopeheads were gonna put theirgreasy yella hands on his boy'sbirthright. So he hid it in the oneplace he knew he could hide somethin'. His ass. Five long years, he worethis watch up his ass. Then when hedied of dysentery, he gave me thewatch. I hid with uncomfortable hunkof metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was senthome to my family. And now, littleman, I give the watch to you.</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's time, Butch.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm ready.</p>
		<p class="spoken">- Well Dan, that had to be thebloodiest and, hands-down, the mostbrutal fight this city has ever seen.</p>
		<p class="spoken">... Coolidge was out of there fasterthan I've ever seen a victoriousboxer vacate the ring. Do you thinkhe knew Willis was dead?</p>
		<p class="spoken">My guess would be yes, Richard. Icould see from my position here, thefrenzy in his eyes give way to therealization of what he was doing. Ithink any man would've left the ringthat fast.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Do you feel this ring death tragedywill have an effect on the world ofboxing?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can'thelp but shake the world of boxingto its very foundation. But it's ofparamount importance that during thesad weeks ahead, the eyes of theW. B. A. remain firmly fixed on the -</p>
		<p class="spoken">Are you the man I was supposed topick up?</p>
		<p class="spoken">If you're the cab I called, I'm theguy you're supposed to pick up.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Where to?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Outta here.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Mia. How you doin'?</p>

		<p class="spoken">Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What does it feel like?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What does what feel like?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Killing a man. Beating another manto death with your bare hands.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Are you some kinda weirdo?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, it's a subject I have muchinterest in. You are the first personI ever met who has killed somebody. So, what was it like to kill a man?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Tell ya what, you give me one ofthem cigarettes, I'll give you ananswer.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Deal!</p>

		<p class="spoken">That's one hell of a name you gotthere, sister.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Thank you. And what is your name?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Butch.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Butch. What does it mean?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm an American, our names don'tmean shit. Anyway, moving right along, what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I want to know what it feels like tokill a man -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- I couldn't tell ya. I didn't knowhe was dead 'til you told me he wasdead. Now I know he's dead, do youwanna know how I feel about it?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't feel the least little bitbad.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What'd I tell ya, soon as the wordgot out a fix was in, the odds wouldbe outta control. Hey, if he was abetter fighter he's be alive. If henever laced up his gloves in thefirst place, which he never shouldadone, he'd be alive. Enough aboutthe poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let'stalk about the rich and prosperousMr. Butch. How many bookies youspread it around with?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Eight? How long to collect?</p>
		<p class="spoken">So by tomorrow evening, you'll haveit all?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Good news Scotty, real good news - Iunderstand a few stragglers aside. Me an' Fabienne're gonna leave inthe morning. It should take us acouple days to get into Knoxville. Next time we see each other, it'llbe on Tennessee time.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Fabienne my love, our adventurebegins.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Forty-five sixty.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Merci beaucoup. And here's a littlesomething for the effort.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now if anybody should ask you aboutwho your fare was tonight, what'reyou gonna tell 'em?</p>
		<p class="spoken">The truth. Three well-dressed, slightly toasted, Mexicans.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Bon soir, Esmarelda.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sleep well, Butch.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Keep the light off.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Is that better, sugar pop?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oui. Hard day at the office?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Pretty hard. I got into a fight.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Poor baby. Can we make spoons?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I was looking at myself in the mirror.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Uh-huh?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I wish I had a pot.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You were lookin' in the mirror andyou wish you had some pot?</p>
		<p class="spoken">A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies aresexy.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well you should be happy, 'cause youdo.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonnawhen she did "Lucky Star, " it's notthe same thing.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I didn't realize there was a difference between a tummy and a potbelly.</p>
		<p class="spoken">The difference is huge.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You want me to have a pot?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No. Pot bellies make a man look either like a fish, or like a gorilla. But on awoman, a pot belly is very sexy. Therest of you is normal. Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normalass, but with a big, perfectly roundpot belly. If I had one, I'd wear atee-shirt two sizes too small toaccentuate it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You think guys would find thatattractive?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't give a damn what men find attractive. It's unfortunate what wefind pleasing to the touch andpleasing to the eye is seldom thesame.</p>
		<p class="spoken">If you a pot belly, I'd punch you init.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You'd punch me in my belly?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Right in the belly.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your right on your face 'til you couldn'tbreathe.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You'd do that to me?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Did you get everything, sugar pop?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes, I did.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Good job.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Did everything go as planned?</p>
		<p class="spoken">You didn't listen to the radio?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I never listen to your fights. Were you the winner?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I won alright.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Are you still retiring?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sure am.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What about the man you fought?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Floyd retired too.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Really?! He won't be fighting no more?!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Not no more.</p>
		<p class="spoken">So it all worked out in the finish?</p>
		<p class="spoken">We ain't at the finish, baby.</p>
		<p class="spoken">We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?</p>
		<p class="spoken">If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they?</p>
		<p class="spoken">But they won't find us, will they?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Do you still want me to go with you?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't want to be a burden or anuisance -</p>
		<p class="spoken">Say it!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Fabienne, I want you to be with me.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Forever?</p>
		<p class="spoken">... and ever.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Do you love me?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oui.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Will you kiss it?</p>
		<p class="spoken">But you first.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Butch my love, the adventure begins.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I think I cracked a rib.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Giving me oral pleasure?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No retard, from the fight.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Don't call me retard.</p>
		<p class="spoken">My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Shut up fuck head! I hate thatMongoloid voice.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take itback! Can I have a towel please, Miss Beautiful Tulip.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oh I like that, I like being calleda tulip. Tulip is much better thanMongoloid.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I didn't call you a Mongoloid, Icalled you a retard, but I took itback.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Merci beaucoup.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Butch?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes, lemon pie.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Where are we going to go?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. We're gonna get a lot of money from this. But it ain't gonna be so much, we can live like hogs in the fathouse forever. I was thinking wecould go somewhere in the SouthPacific. The kinda money we'll have'llcarry us a long way down there.</p>
		<p class="spoken">So if we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?</p>
		<p class="spoken">You betcha. And if after awhile youdon't dig Bora Bora, then we canmove over to Tahiti or Mexico.</p>
		<p class="spoken">But I do not speak Spanish.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You don't speak Bora Boran either.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde estael zapataria?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What does that mean?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Where's the shoe store?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Donde esta el zapataria?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Excellent pronunciation. You'll bemy little mama ceta in no time.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Que hora es?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Que hora es?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What time is it?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What time is it?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Butch.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Forget it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Merde! You startled me. Did you havea bad dream?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What are you watching?</p>
		<p class="spoken">A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure thename.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Are you watchin' it?</p>
		<p class="spoken">In a way. Why? Would you like for meto switch it off?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Would you please?</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's a little too early in the morning for explosions and war.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What was it about?</p>
		<p class="spoken">How should I know, you were the one watchin' it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, imbecile, what was your dreamabout?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oh, I... don't remember. It's reallyrare I remember a dream.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You just woke up from it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, Idon't remember.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, let's look at the grumpy manin the morning. I didn't say youwere lying, it's just odd you don'tremember your dreams. I alwaysremember mine. Did you know you talkin your sleep?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't talk in my sleep, do I talkin my sleep?</p>
		<p class="spoken">You did last night.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What did I say?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't know. I couldn't understandyou.</p>

		<p class="spoken">Why the fuck did you do that?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I didn't mean to do it. I said itwas an accident.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit inmy time -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- chill out, man, it was an accident, okay? You hit a bump or somethin'and the gun went off.</p>
		<p class="spoken">The car didn't hit no motherfuckin'bump!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Look! I didn't mean to shoot thisson-ofa-bitch, the gun just wentoff, don't ask me how!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Look at this mess! We're drivin'around on a city street in broaddaylight -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin'about the splatter.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well you better be thinkin' about itnow, motherfucker! We gotta get thiscar off the road. Cops tend to noticeshit like you're driving a cardrenched in fuckin' blood.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Can't we just take it to a friendlyplace?</p>
		<p class="spoken">This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellusdon't got no friendly places in theValley.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, don't look at me, this is yourtown, Jules.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Who ya callin'?</p>
		<p class="spoken">A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Where's Toluca Lake.</p>
		<p class="spoken">On the other side of the hill, byBurbank Studios. If Jimmie's assain't home, I don't know what thefuck we're gonna go. I ain't got anyother partners in 818.</p>

		<p class="spoken">Listen up man, me an' my homeboy arein some serious shit. We're in a carwe gotta get off the road, pronto! Ineed to use your garage for a couplehours.</p>
		<p class="spoken">We gotta be real fuckin' delicatewith this Jimmie's situation. He'sone remark away from kickin' ourasses out the door.</p>
		<p class="spoken">If he kicks us out, whadda we do?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we madea couple phone calls. But I neverwant it to reach that pitch. Jimmie'smy friend and you don't bust in yourfriend's house and start tellin' 'imwhat's what.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Just tell 'im not to be abusive. Hekinda freaked out back there when hesaw Marvin.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Put yourself in his position. It'seight o'clock in the morning. Hejust woke up, he wasn't prepared forthis shit. Don't forget who's doin'who a favor.</p>
		<p class="spoken">If the price of that favor is I gottatake shit, he can stick his favorstraight up his ass.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What the fuck did you just do to histowel?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I was just dryin' my hands.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You're supposed to wash 'em first.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You watched me wash 'em.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I watched you get 'em wet.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I washed 'em. Blood's real hard toget off. Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda done a better job.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I used the same soap you did andwhen I dried my hands, the toweldidn't look like a fuckin' Maxiepad. Look, fuck it, alright. Whocares? But it's shit like this that'sgonna bring this situation to a boil. If he were to come in here and seethat towel like that... I'm tellin'you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Causeif I gotta get in to it with Jimmieon account of you... Look, I ain'tthreatenin' you, I respect you an'all, just don't put me in thatposition.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Jules, you ask me nice like that, noproblem. He's your friend, you handlehim.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Goddamn Jimmie, this is some seriousgourmet shit. Me an' Vincent wouldabeen satisfied with freeze-driedTasters Choice. You spring thisgourmet fuckin' shit on us. Whatflavor is this?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Knock it off, Julie.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm not a cobb or corn, so you canstop butterin' me up. I don't needyou to tell me how good my coffeeis. I'm the one who buys it, I knowhow fuckin' good it is. When Bonniegoes shoppin;, she buys shit. I buythe gourmet expensive stuff 'causewhen I drink it, I wanna taste it. But what's on my mind at this momentisn't the coffee in my kitchen, it'sthe dead nigger in my garage.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Jimmie -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you aquestion, Jules. When you drove inhere, did you notice a sign out frontthat said, "Dead nigger storage?"</p>
		<p class="spoken">- answer to question. Did you see asign out in front of my house thatsaid, "Dead nigger storage?"</p>
		<p class="spoken">Naw man, I didn't.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You know why you didn't see thatsign?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Why?</p>
		<p class="spoken">'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't myfuckin' business!</p>
		<p class="spoken">- I ain't through! Now don't youunderstand that if Bonnie comes homeand finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced. No marriagecounselor, no trial separation -fuckin' divorced. And I don't wannaget fuckin' divorced. The last timeme an' Bonnie talked about this shitwas gonna be the last time me an'Bonnie talked about this shit. Now Iwanna help ya out Julie, I reallydo. But I ain't gonna lose my wifedoin' it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Jimmie -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, Ican't be Jimmied. There's nothin'you can say that's gonna make meforget I love my wife. Now she'sworkin' the graveyard shift at thehospital. She'll be comin' home inless than an hour and a half. Makeyour phone calls, talk to your people, than get the fuck out of my house.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's all we want. We don't wannafuck up your shit. We just need tocall our people to bring us in.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Then I suggest you get to it. Phone'sin my bedroom.</p>

		<p class="spoken">No fuckin' shit she'll freak. Thatain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, I don't. How bad, a lot or a little?</p>
		<p class="spoken">You got to appreciate what anexplosive element this Bonniesituation is. If she comes home froma hard day's work and finds a bunchof gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta'shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin'what she's apt to do.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I've grasped that, Jules. All I'mdoin' is contemplating the "ifs. "</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't wanna hear about nomotherfuckin' "ifs. "What I wannahear from your ass is: "you ain'tgot no problems, Jules. I'm on themotherfucker. Go back in there, chillthem niggers out and wait for thecavalry, which should be comin'directly. "</p>
		<p class="spoken">You ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back inthere, chill them niggers out andwait for The Wolf, who should becomin' directly.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You sendin' The Wolf?</p>

		<p class="spoken">You're Jimmie, right? This is yourhouse?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Good, 'cause we got one.</p>
		<p class="spoken">So I heard. May I come in?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Please do.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You must be Jules, which would makeyou Vincent. Let's get down to brasstacks, gentlemen. If I was informedcorrectly, the clock is ticking, isthat right, Jimmie?</p>
		<p class="spoken">100%.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Your wife, Bonnie...</p>
		<p class="spoken">... comes home at 9:30 in the AM, isthat correct?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Uh-huh.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I was led to believe if she comeshome and finds us here, she wouldn'tappreciate it none too much.</p>
		<p class="spoken">She won't at that.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That gives us forty minutes to getthe fuck outta Dodge, which, if youdo what I say when I say it, shouldby plenty. Now you got a corpse in acar, minus a head, in a garage. Takeme to it.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Jimmie?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Do me a favor, will ya? Thought Ismelled some coffee in there. Wouldyou make me a cup?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sure, how do you take it?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.</p>
		<p class="spoken">About the car, is there anything Ineed to know? Does it stall, does itmake a lot of noise, does it smoke, is there gas in it, anything?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Aside from how it looks, the car'scool.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Positive? Don't get me out on theroad and I find out the brake lightsdon't work.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hey man, as far as I know, themotherfucker's tip-top.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Good enough, let's go back to thekitchen.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Thank you, Jimmie.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Okay first thing, you two.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Take the body, stick it in the trunk. Now Jimmie, this looks to be a prettydomesticated house. That would leadme to believe that in the garage orunder the sink, you got a bunch ofcleansers and cleaners and shit likethat, am I correct?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Good. What I need you two fellas todo is take those cleaning productsand clean the inside of the car. AndI'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. Youneed to go in the backseat, scoop upall those little pieces of brain andskull. Get it out of there. Wipedown the upholstery - now when itcomes to upholstery, it don't needto be spic and span, you don't needto eat off it. Give it a good onceover. What you need to take care ofare the really messy parts. The poolsof blood that have collected, yougotta soak that shit up. But thewindows are a different story. Themyou really clean. Get the Windex, doa good job. Now Jimmie, we need toraid your linen closet. I needblankets, I need comforters, I needquilts, I need bedspreads. The thickerthe better, the darker the better. No whites, can't use 'em. We need tocamouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat andthe backseat and the floor boardswith quilts and blankets. If a copstops us and starts stickin' his bigsnout in the car, the subterfugewon't last. But at a glance, the carwill appear to be normal. Jimmie -lead the way, boys - get to work.</p>
		<p class="spoken">A "please" would be nice.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Come again?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I said a "please" would be nice.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Set is straight, Buster. I'm nothere to say "please. "I'm here totell you want to do. And if self-</p>
		<p class="spoken">preservation is an instinct youpossess, you better fuckin' do itand do it quick. I'm here to help.</p>
		<p class="spoken">If my help's not appreciated, lotsaluck gentlemen.</p>
		<p class="spoken">It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Yourhelp is definitely appreciated.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't mean any disrespect. I justdon't like people barkin' orders atme.</p>
		<p class="spoken">If I'm curt with you, it's becausetime is a factor. I think fast, Italk fast, and I need you guys toact fast if you want to get out ofthis. So pretty please, with sugaron top, clean the fuckin' car.</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.</p>
		<p class="spoken">White.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Nothin', except for the mess inside.</p>
		<p class="spoken">About twenty minutes.</p>

		<p class="spoken">How we comin', Jimmie?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Mr. Wolf, you gotta understandsomethin' -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- Winston, Jimmie - please, Winston.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You gotta understand something, Winston. I want to help you guys outand all, but that's my best linen. It was a wedding present from myUncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, andthey ain't with us anymore -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- let me ask you a question, if youdon't mind?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sure.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginnymillionaires?</p>

		<p class="spoken">I like oak myself, that's what's inmy bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, you an oak man?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oak's nice.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I will never forgive your ass forthis shit. This is some fucked-uprepugnant shit!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Did you ever hear the philosophythat once a man admits he's wrong, he's immediately forgiven for allwrong-doings?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Man, get outta my face with thatshit! The motherfucker who said thatnever had to pick up itty-bitty piecesof skull with his fingers on accountof your dumb ass.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I got a threshold, Jules. I got athreshold for the abuse I'll take. And you're crossin' it. I'm a racecar and you got me in the red. Redline7000, that's where you are. Justknow, it's fuckin' dangerous to bedrivin' a race car when it's in thered. It could blow.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm amushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brainI'm "SUPERFLY T. N. T, " I'm the "GUNSOF NAVARONE. " I'm what Jimmie Walkerusta talk about. In fact, what thefuck am I doin' in the back? You'rethe motherfucker should be on braindetail. We're tradin'.

		<p class="spoken">You know what you two look like?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Like a couple of guys who just blewoff somebody's head. Yes, strippin'off those bloody rags is absolutelynecessary. Toss the clothes in Jim'sgarbage bag.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupidlike puttin' that out in front ofyour house for Elmo the garbage manto take away.</p>

The place is North Hollywood, so afew twist and turns aside, we'll begoin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'lldrive the tainted car. Jules, youride with me. Vincent, you followin my Porsche. Now if we cross thepath of any John Q. Laws, nobodydoes a fuckin' thing 'til I dosomething.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What did I say?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Don't do shit unless -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- unless what?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Unless you do it first.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Spoken like a true prodigy.</p>
		<p class="spoken">How 'bout you, Lash Larue? Can youkeep your spurs from jingling andjangling?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just wentoff, I dunno how.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Fair enough.</p>

		<p class="spoken">We cool?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Like it never happened.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, allthis will be hers.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hi. You know, if they ever do "ISPY: THE MOTION PICTURE, " you guys, I'd be great. What's with theoutfits. You guys going to avolleyball game?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. Maybe I can drop you two off. Wheredo you live?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Redondo Beach.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Inglewood.</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's your future: I see... a cabride.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Say goodbye, Raquel.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Goodbye, Raquel.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'll see you two around, and stayoutta trouble, you crazy kids.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Mr. Wolf.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I was a pleasure watchin' you work.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Call me Winston.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You hear that, young lady? Respect. You could lean a lot from those twofine specimens. Respect for one'selders shows character.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I have character.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Just because you are a characterdoesn't mean you have character.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oh you're so funny, oh you're sofunny.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Wanna share a cab?</p>
		<p class="spoken">You know I could go for somebreakfast. Want to have breakfastwith me?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sure.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Thanks a bunch.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Want a sausage?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Naw, I don't eat pork.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Are you Jewish?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I ain't Jewish man, I just don't digon swine.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Why not?</p>
		<p class="spoken">They're filthy animals. I don't eatfilthy animals.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sausages taste good. Pork chops tastegood.</p>
		<p class="spoken">A sewer rat may taste like pumpkinpie. I'll never know 'cause even ifit did, I wouldn't eat the filthymotherfucker. Pigs sleep and root inshit. That's a filthy animal. I don'twanna eat nothin' that ain't gotenough sense to disregard its ownfeces.</p>
		<p class="spoken">How about dogs? Dogs eat their ownfeces.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't eat dog either.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes, but do you consider a dog to bea filthy animal?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I wouldn't go so far as to call adog filthy, but they're definitelydirty. But a dog's got personality. And personality goes a long way.</p>
		<p class="spoken">So by that rationale, if a pig had abetter personality, he's cease to bea filthy animal?</p>
		<p class="spoken">We'd have to be talkin' 'bout onemotherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'dhave to be the Cary Grant of pigs.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Good for you. Lighten up a little. You been sittin' there all quiet.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I just been sittin' here thinkin'.</p>
		<p class="spoken">About what?</p>
		<p class="spoken">The miracle we witnessed.</p>
		<p class="spoken">The miracle you witnessed. I witnesseda freak occurrence.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Do you know that a miracle is?</p>
		<p class="spoken">An act of God.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's an act of God?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I guess it's when God makes theimpossible possible. And I'm sorryJules, but I don't think what happenedthis morning qualifies.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Don't you see, Vince, that shit don'tmatter. You're judging this thingthe wrong way. It's not about what. It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he foundmy fuckin' car keys. You don't judgeshit like this based on merit. Whetheror not what we experienced was anaccording-to-Hoyle miracle isinsignificant. What is significantis I felt God's touch, God gotinvolved.</p>
		<p class="spoken">But why?</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's what's fuckin' wit' me! Idon't know why. But I can't go backto sleep.</p>
		<p class="spoken">So you're serious, you're reallygonna quit?</p>
		<p class="spoken">The life, most definitely.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Garcon! Coffee!</p>
		<p class="spoken">So if you're quitting the life, what'll you do?</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's what I've been sitting herecontemplating. First, I'm gonnadeliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What do you mean, walk the earth?</p>
		<p class="spoken">You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU. "Just walk from town to town, meetpeople, get in adventures.</p>
		<p class="spoken">How long do you intend to walk theearth?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Until God puts me where he want meto be.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What if he never does?</p>
		<p class="spoken">If it takes forever, I'll waitforever.</p>
		<p class="spoken">So you decided to be a bum?</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'll just be Jules, Vincent - nomore, no less.</p>
		<p class="spoken">No Jules, you're gonna be like thosepieces of shit out there who beg forchange. They walk around like a bunchof fuckin' zombies, they sleep ingarbage bins, they eat what I throwaway, and dogs piss on 'em. They gota word for 'em, they're called bums. And without a job, residence, orlegal tender, that's what you'regonna be - a fuckin' bum!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Look my friend, this is just whereme and you differ -</p>
		<p class="spoken">- what happened was peculiar - nodoubt about it - but it wasn't waterinto wine.</p>
		<p class="spoken">All shapes and sizes, Vince.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!</p>
		<p class="spoken">If you find my answers frightening, Vincent, you should cease askin'scary questions.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I gotta take a shit. To be continued.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Any of you fuckin' pricks move andI'll execute every one of youmotherfuckers! Got that?!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Customers stay seated, waitresses onthe floor.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, do it or fucking die!</p>

		<p class="spoken">I'm the manager here, there's noproblem, no problem at all -</p>
		<p class="spoken">You're gonna give me a problem?</p>
		<p class="spoken">What? You said you're gonna give mea problem?</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give youany problem!</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't know, Honey Bunny. He lookslike the hero type to me!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Don't take any chances. Execute him!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'mjust a coffee shop manager. Takeanything you want.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Tell everyone to cooperate and it'llbe all over.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Everybody just be calm and cooperatewith them and this will be all oversoon!</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well done, now git your fuckin' asson the ground.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Okay people, I'm going to go 'roundand collect your wallets. Don't talk, just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?</p>
		<p class="spoken">In the bag.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's in that?</p>
		<p class="spoken">My boss' dirty laundry.</p>
		<p class="spoken">You boss makes you do his laundry?</p>
		<p class="spoken">When he wants it clean.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sounds like a shit job.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Funny, I've been thinkin' the samething.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Open it up.</p>
		<p class="spoken">'Fraid I can't do that.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I didn't hear you.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes, you did.</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's goin' on?</p>
		<p class="spoken">Looks like we got a vigilante in ourmidst.</p>
		<p class="spoken">Shoot 'em in the face!</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I'vehad gun pointed at me.</p>

		<p class="spoken">Not regularly.</p>
		<p class="spoken">There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of therighteous man is beset on all sidesby the inequities of the selfish andthe tyranny of evil men. Blessed ishe who, in the name of charity andgood will, shepherds the weak throughthe valley of the darkness. For heis truly his brother's keeper andthe finder of lost children. And Iwill strike down upon thee with greatvengeance and furious anger thosewho attempt to poison and destroy mybrothers. And you will know I am theLord when I lay my vengeance uponyou. " I been sayin' that shit foryears. And if you ever heard it, itmeant your ass. I never reallyquestioned what it meant. I thoughtit was just a coldblooded thing tosay to a motherfucker 'fore you poppeda cap in his ass. But I saw someshit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you'rethe evil man. And I'm the righteousman. And Mr. . 45 here, he's theshepherd protecting my righteous assin the valley of darkness. Or iscould by you're the righteous manand I'm the shepherd and it's theworld that's evil and selfish. I'dlike that. But that shit ain't thetruth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. ButI'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard tobe a shepherd.</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's cold.</p>
		<p class="spoken">I think we oughta leave now.</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's probably a good idea.</p>
