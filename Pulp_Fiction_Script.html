		<p class="location">INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING</p>
		<p class="text">A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and eating eggs.</p>
		<p class="text">Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're going out of style.</p>
		<p class="text">It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how old she is; everything she does contradicts something she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but -</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">- but you forget about it in a day or two -</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">- yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">When you go on like this, you know what you sound like?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">You sound like a duck.</p>
		<p class="scene">(imitates a duck)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack...</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. Because since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">After tonight.</p>
		<p class="text">The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there, back and forth.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="scene">(with a smile)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Correct. I got all tonight to quack.</p>
		<p class="text">A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.</p>
		<p class="actor">WAITRESS</p>
		<p class="spoken">Can I get anybody anymore coffee?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oh yes, thank you.</p>
		<p class="text">The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man lights up another cigarette.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm doin' fine.</p>
		<p class="text">The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his smoke.</p>
		<p class="text">The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee.</p>
		<p class="text">The Young Man goes right back into it.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are easier! Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. They'reinsured, why should they care? You d on't even need a gun in a federal bank. I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: "We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er. "</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Did it work?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about! Knucklehead walks i na bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Did they hurt the little girl?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't know. There probably never was a little girl - the point of the story isn't the little girl. The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">You wanna rob banks?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">So you don't want to be a bank robber?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">And no more liquor stores?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">What have we been talking about? Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:"Empty out the register, " and they don't know what it fuckin' means. They make it too personal. We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers'gonna make us kill 'em.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm not gonna kill anybody.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them. And if it's not the gooks, it these oldJews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya gotGrandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, what else is there, day jobs?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="scene">(laughing)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Not this life.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well what then?</p>
		<p class="text">He calls to the Waitress.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Garcon! Coffee!</p>
		<p class="text">Then looks to his girl.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">This place.</p>
		<p class="text">The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.</p>
		<p class="actor">WAITRESS</p>
		<p class="scene">(snotty)</p>
		<p class="spoken">"Garcon" means boy.</p>
		<p class="text">She splits.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Here? It's a coffee shop.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's wrong with that? People never rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="scene">(taking to idea)</p>
		<p class="spoken">I bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Correct. Just like banks, these places are insured. The managers don't give a fuck, they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners. Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register. Busboys, some wet back gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner. Customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin'on. One minute they're havin' a Denver omelet, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face.</p>
		<p class="text">The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man continues in a low voice.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">See, I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. 'Member all those customers kept comin' in?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Then you got the idea to take everybody's wallet.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Uh-huh.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">That was a good idea.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Thanks.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">We made more from the wallets then we did the register.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes we did.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">A lot of people go to restaurants.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">A lot of wallets.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Pretty smart, huh?</p>
		<p class="text">The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new information.</p>
		<p class="text">She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's face.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Pretty smart.</p>
		<p class="scene">(into it)</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm ready, let's go, right here, right now.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Remember, same as before, you're crowd control, I handle the employees.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Got it.</p>
		<p class="text">They both take out their . 32-caliber pistols and lay them on the table. He looks at her and she back at him.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I love you, Pumpkin.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I love you, Honey Bunny.</p>
		<p class="text">And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="scene">(yelling to all)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Everybody be cool this is a robbery!</p>
		<p class="actor">HONEY BUNNY</p>
		<p class="spoken">Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers! Got that?</p>

		<p class="location">INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) - MORNING</p>
		<p class="text">An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front seat are two young fellas - one white, one black - both wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">- Okay now, tell me about the hash bars?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">What so you want to know?</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, hash is legal there, right?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Those are hash bars?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor ofa hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause - get a load of this - if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">That did it, man - I'm fuckin' goin', that's all there is to it.</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">You'll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they're a little different.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Examples?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. InParis, you can buy beer atMacDonald's. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder withCheese in Paris?</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck aQuarter Pounder is.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">What'd they call it?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Royale with Cheese.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="scene">(repeating)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Royale with Cheese. What'd they calla Big Mac?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Le Big Mac. What do they call aWhopper?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">I dunno, I didn't go into a BurgerKing. But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Mayonnaise.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Goddamn!</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it.</p>

		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">How many up there?</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Three or four.</p>

		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">She ever do anything I woulda saw?</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's a pilot?</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, you know the shows on TV?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't watch TV.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes, but you're aware that there'san invention called television, and on that invention they show shows?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, the way they pick the shows onTV is they make one show, and thats how's called a pilot. And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get accepted and become TV programs, and some don't, and become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

		<p class="spoken">I think I know who you mean, what about him?</p>

		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">It ain't no ballpark either. Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holiest of holies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport.</p>

		<p class="text">In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over L. A. , giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book, Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolf man Jack Omelet, and over prices that pay for all this bullshit.</p>
		<p class="text">But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's diners.</p>
		<p class="text">Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of view.</p>
		<p class="text">Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine. "</p>

		<p class="text">Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint English pub. Posters from 50's A. I. P. movies are all over the wall</p>
		<p class="text">("ROCK ALL NIGHT, " "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL, " "ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTER, " and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s cars.</p>
		<p class="text">In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign on the wall states, "No shoes allowed. " Some wannabe beboppers (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or bare feet.</p>
		<p class="text">The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing appropriate costumes.</p>
		<p class="text">Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red '59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing you please me. "</p>

		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Think nothing of it.</p>
		<p class="text">He begins rolling one for himself.</p>
		<p class="text">As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.</p>

		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">What was it?</p>

		<p class="spoken">"Fox Force Five. " Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with. Five, as in there's one... two ... three... four... five of us. There was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal from that show "Baton Rouge, " she was the leader. A Japanese one, a black one, a French one and a brunette one, me. We all had special skills. Sommerset had a photographic memory, the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the French fox' specialty was sex...</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">What was your specialty?</p>
		<p class="actor">MIA</p>
		<p class="spoken">Knives. The character I played, RavenMcCoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. So she grew up doing a knife act. According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife. But because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat. She could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist - when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy. And she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. If we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode I woulda told and ol joke.</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Do you remember any of the jokes?</p>

		<p class="actor">MIA</p>
		<p class="spoken">A husband being protective of his wife is one thing. A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">But did it happen?</p>
		<p class="actor">MIA</p>
		<p class="spoken">The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan once - at my wedding- then never again. The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossedTony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony RockyHorror. But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.</p>

		<p class="text">Then...</p>
		<p class="text">The two just stand face to face looking at each other.</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Was than an uncomfortable silence?</p>
		<p class="actor">MIA</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't know what that was.</p>
		<p class="scene">(pause)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Music and drinks!</p>
		<p class="text">Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm gonna take a piss.</p>
		<p class="actor">MIA</p>
		<p class="spoken">That was a little bit more information than I needed to know, but go right ahead.</p>
		<p class="text">Vincent shuffles off to the john.</p>
		<p class="text">Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs and selects one: k. d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It feels good.</p>
		<p class="text">Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.</p>
		<p class="text">The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face.</p>

		<p class="text">LIVING ROOM</p>
		<p class="text">We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. Slack-jawed.</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Jesus Christ!</p>
		<p class="text">Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body. Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.</p>

		<p class="spoken">Okay, what do I do?</p>
		<p class="actor">LANCE</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, you're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart. But she's got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that. So what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.</p>
		<p class="text">Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".</p>

Next to her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old boy.</p>

		<p class="actor">CAPT. KOONS</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard a bunch about you. See, I was a good friend of your Daddy's. We were in that Hanoi pit of hell over five years together. Hopefully, you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your Daddy were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other. If it had been me who had not made it, Major Coolidge would be talkin' right now to my son Jim. But the way it worked out is I'm talkin'to you, Butch. I got somethin' for ya.</p>
		<p class="text">The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.</p>
		<p class="actor">CAPT. KOONS</p>
		<p class="spoken">This watch I got here was first purchased by your great-granddaddy. It was bought during the First WorldWar in a little general store inKnoxville, Tennessee. It was bought by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge the day he set sail for Paris. It was your great-granddaddy's war watch, made by the first company to ever make wrist watches. You see, up until then, people just carried pocket watches. Your great-granddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the war. Then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great-</p>
		<p class="spoken">grandmother, took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol' coffee can. And in that can it stayed 'til your grandfather Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again. This time they called it WorldWar Two. Your great-granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's. Your granddad was a Marine and he was killed with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island. Your granddad was facing death and he knew it. None of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin' that island alive. So three days before the Japanese took the island, your 22-year old grandfather asked a gunner on an AirForce transport named Winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he had never seen in the flesh, his gold watch. Three days later, your grandfather was dead. But Winocki kept his word. After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his Dad's gold watch. This watch. This watch was on your Daddy's wrist when he was shot down overHanoi. He was captured and put in aVietnamese prison camp. Now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it'dbe confiscated. The way your Daddy looked at it, that watch was your birthright. And he'd be damned if any slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yell a hands on his boy's birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin'. His ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you.</p>

		<p class="spoken">I was looking at myself in the mirror.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">Uh-huh?</p>
		<p class="actor">FABIENNE</p>
		<p class="spoken">I wish I had a pot.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">You were lookin' in the mirror and you wish you had some pot?</p>
		<p class="actor">FABIENNE</p>
		<p class="spoken">A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are sexy.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well you should be happy, 'cause you do.</p>
		<p class="actor">FABIENNE</p>
		<p class="spoken">Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star, " it's not the same thing.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">I didn't realize there was a difference between a tummy and a potbelly.</p>
		<p class="actor">FABIENNE</p>
		<p class="spoken">The difference is huge.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">You want me to have a pot?</p>
		<p class="actor">FABIENNE</p>
		<p class="spoken">No. Pot bellies make a man look either like a fish, or like a gorilla. But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The rest of you is normal. Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass, but with a big, perfectly round pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">You think guys would find that attractive?</p>
		<p class="actor">FABIENNE</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't give a damn what men find attractive. It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">If you a pot belly, I'd punch you init.</p>
		<p class="actor">FABIENNE</p>
		<p class="spoken">You'd punch me in my belly?</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">Right in the belly.</p>
		<p class="actor">FABIENNE</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">You'd do that to me?</p>
		<p class="actor">FABIENNE</p>

The only things personal in his room are a few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.</p>
		<p class="text">Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.</p>
		<p class="text">He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and puts them in the toaster.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.</p>
		<p class="text">What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="scene">(softly)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Holy shit.</p>
		<p class="text">He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines it.</p>
		<p class="text">Then... a toilet FLUSHES.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the kitchen. There is someone behind it.</p>
		<p class="text">Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not knowing what to do.</p>
		<p class="text">The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.</p>
		<p class="text">Vincent and Butch lock eyes.</p>
		<p class="text">Vincent freezes.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's direction.</p>
		<p class="text">Neither man opens his mouth.</p>
		<p class="text">Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.</p>
		<p class="text">That's all the situation needed.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch's finger HITS the trigger.</p>
		<p class="text">MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.</p>
		<p class="text">Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets SIMULTANEOUSLY - LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom.</p>
		<p class="text">By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent is annihilated.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.</p>
		<p class="text">With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 back on the kitchen counter.</p>
		<p class="text">Then he exits the apartment, quickly.</p>
		<p class="location">EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the courtyard...</p>
		<p class="text">... comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...</p>
		<p class="text">... goes through the alley...</p>
		<p class="text">... and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.</p>

		<p class="text">Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide smile of a survivor breaks across his face.</p>

		<p class="text">The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment building.</p>
		<p class="location">INT. HONDA - DAY</p>

		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch. They keep underestimatin' ya.</p>
		<p class="text">This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he SINGS along with it.</p>
		<p class="text">He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see:</p>
		<p class="text">THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD</p>
		<p class="text">The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see Marsellus clearly.</p>
		<p class="text">Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him.</p>
		<p class="text">When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!</p>
		<p class="text">DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"</p>
		<p class="text">Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. He STOMPS on the gas pedal.</p>
		<p class="text">The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on the sidewalk.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.</p>
		<p class="actor">PEDESTRIAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Jesus, are you okay?</p>
		<p class="text">Butch look at him, spaced-out.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>

		<p class="actor">MARSELLUS</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, I'll be damned.</p>
		<p class="text">The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back away.</p>
		<p class="text">Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward him.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sacre bleu.</p>
		<p class="text">Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.</p>
		<p class="text">He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, screaming.</p>
		<p class="actor">LOOKY-LOO WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oh my God, I've been shot!</p>
		<p class="text">That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.</p>
		<p class="text">Marsellus RUNS after him.</p>
		<p class="text">The CROWD looks agape.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.</p>
		<p class="text">The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".</p>
		<p class="location">INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of Butch RACES into his world.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Can I help you wit' somethin'?</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">Shut up!</p>
		<p class="text">Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next to the door.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now you just wait one goddamn minute-</p>
		<p class="text">Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist in Marsellus' face.</p>
		<p class="text">The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man FALLS FLAT on his back.</p>
		<p class="text">Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in the face.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold of his middle finger.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">So you like chasing people, huh?</p>
		<p class="text">He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound. Butch then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the splatter.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well guess what, big man, you caught me -</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD (O.S.)</p>
		<p class="spoken">- hold it right there, god dammit!</p>
		<p class="text">Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a pump action shotgun, aimed at the two men.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">Look mister, this ain't any of your business -</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>

		<p class="text">Butch does.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now you on top, stand up and come to the counter.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.</p>
		<p class="text">After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the counter and moves to the telephone.</p>
		<p class="text">Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just caught a coupl' a flies.</p>

		<p class="text">TWO SHOT - BUTCH AND MARSELLUS</p>
		<p class="text">They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are unconscious.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two prisoners look up at their captors.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in his belt.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or Zed.</p>
		<p class="text">A BUZZER buzzes.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's Zed.</p>
		<p class="text">Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs that lead to red curtains and goes through them.</p>
		<p class="text">WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed inside the store.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what they've gotten themselves into.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. The two hillbillies are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is a vicious pit bull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a long time, then says:</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED</p>
		<p class="scene">(to Maynard)</p>
		<p class="spoken">You said you waited for me?</p>

		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, it's Thursday.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Then she'll be fine.</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED</p>
		<p class="spoken">Bring out The Gimp.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">I think The Gimp's sleepin'.</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em up then, won't you?</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="scene">(yelling in the hole)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Wake up!</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a leash.</p>
		<p class="text">He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises THE GIMP.</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large dog.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, then backs away.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="scene">(to The Gimp)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Down!</p>

		<p class="spoken">Who's first?</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED</p>
		<p class="spoken">I ain't fer sure yet.</p>
		<p class="text">Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger going back and forth between the two.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch are Marsellus are terrified.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving left to right, then it stops.</p>
		<p class="text">TWO SHOT - BUTCH AND MARSELLUS</p>
		<p class="text">After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on Marsellus.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed stands up.</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED</p>
		<p class="spoken">Wanna do it here?</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old room.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old room.</p>
		<p class="text">Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty.</p>
		<p class="text">As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="scene">(to The Gimp)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Up!</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on the ceiling.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Keep an eye on this one.</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp bows its head: "yes. " Maynard disappears into Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy.</p>
		<p class="text">From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD (O.S.)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight in 'em!</p>
		<p class="text">We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED (O.S.)</p>
		<p class="spoken">You wanna fight? You wanna fight?Good, I like to fight!</p>
		<p class="text">Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, hurriedly struggles to get free.</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp is laughing wildly.</p>
		<p class="text">The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD (O.S.)</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's it... that's it boy, you're goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like that... that's good.</p>
		<p class="scene">(grunting faster)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Stay still... stay still goddamn ya! Zed goddammit, git over here and hold 'em!</p>
		<p class="text">Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were never connected by a bolt.</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.</p>
		<p class="actor">THE GIMP</p>
		<p class="spoken">Huhng?</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through the red curtains.</p>
		<p class="location">INT. PAWNSHOP - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">Butch sneaks to the door.</p>
		<p class="text">On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with Marsellus.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in with.</p>
		<p class="text">He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots what he's been looking for:</p>
		<p class="text">A Samurai sword.</p>
		<p class="text">It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the sword pointed downward, Takakura Ken style, he disappears through the red curtains to take care of business.</p>
		<p class="location">INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.</p>
		<p class="text">Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.</p>
		<p class="location">INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched positions.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden horse.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up behind him with the sword.</p>
		<p class="text">Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hey hillbilly.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on Zed.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, which lies within reach.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch's eyes follow Zed's.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed studies Butch.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch looks hard at Zed.</p>
		<p class="text">Then a VOICE says:</p>
		<p class="actor">MARSELLUS (O.S.)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Step aside, Butch.</p>

		<p class="text">KABOOM! ! ! !</p>
		<p class="text">Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.</p>

You need to go in the backseat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there. Wipe down the upholstery - now when it comes to upholstery, it don't need to be spic and span, you don't need to eat off it. Give it a good once over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts. The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up. But the windows are a different story. Them you really clean. Get the Windex, doa good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet. I need blankets, I need comforters, I need quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites, can't use 'em. We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets. If a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last. But at a glance, the car will appear to be normal. Jimmie -lead the way, boys - get to work.</p>

		<p class="spoken">I'll just be Jules, Vincent - no more, no less.</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">No Jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change. They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throwaway, and dogs piss on 'em. They go ta word for 'em, they're called bums. And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be - a fuckin' bum!</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Look my friend, this is just where me and you differ -</p>

		<p class="actor">HONEY BUNNY</p>
		<p class="spoken">Any of you fuckin' pricks move andI'll execute every one of you motherfuckers! Got that?!</p>
		<p class="text">Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it out, COCKING IT.</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Customers stay seated, waitresses on the floor.</p>
		<p class="actor">HONEY BUNNY</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, do it or fucking die!</p>
		<p class="text">Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them terrified.</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out here! Asta luego!</p>
		<p class="text">Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.</p>

		<p class="text">They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.</p>
		<p class="actor">MANAGER</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm the manager here, there's no problem, no problem at all -</p>
		<p class="text">Pumpkin heads his way.</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">You're gonna give me a problem?</p>
		<p class="text">He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the Manager's neck.</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">What? You said you're gonna give mea problem?</p>
		<p class="actor">MANAGER</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you any problem!</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks like the hero type to me!</p>
		<p class="actor">HONEY BUNNY</p>
		<p class="spoken">Don't take any chances. Execute him!</p>
		<p class="text">The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.</p>
		<p class="actor">MANAGER</p>
		<p class="spoken">Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm just a coffee shop manager. Take anything you want.</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll be all over.</p>
		<p class="actor">MANAGER</p>
		<p class="spoken">Everybody just be calm and cooperate with them and this will be all over soon!</p>

		<p class="text">Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter with a trash bag in his hand.</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Okay people, I'm going to go 'round and collect your wallets. Don't talk, just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?</p>
		<p class="text">Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his .45 ready to spit under the table.</p>
		<p class="text">Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more respectful, him manner more on guard.</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">In the bag.</p>
		<p class="text">Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, Pumpkin points to the briefcase.</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's in that?</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">My boss' dirty laundry.</p>

		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">'Fraid I can't do that.</p>
		<p class="text">Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the hammer.</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I didn't hear you.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes, you did.</p>
		<p class="text">This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.</p>
		<p class="actor">HONEY BUNNY</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's goin' on?</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.</p>
		<p class="actor">HONEY BUNNY</p>
		<p class="spoken">Shoot 'em in the face!</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had gun pointed at me.</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">You don't open up that case, it's gonna be the last.</p>
		<p class="actor">MANAGER</p>
		<p class="scene">(on the ground)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Quit causing problems, you'll get us all killed! Give 'em what you got and get 'em out of here.</p>

		<p class="spoken">Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat man, this ain't any of your goddamn business!</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm countin' to three, and if your hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna unload right in your fuckin' face. Clear? One...</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">... two... three.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>

		<p class="text">Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's all yours, Ringo.</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Open it.</p>
		<p class="text">Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across the room, can't see shit.</p>
		<p class="actor">HONEY BUNNY</p>
		<p class="spoken">What is it? What is it?</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>

		<p class="actor">HONEY BUNNY</p>
		<p class="spoken">Goddammit, what is it?</p>
		<p class="text">Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the case.</p>
		<p class="text">Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 hand under Pumpkin's chin.</p>
		<p class="text">Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.</p>
		<p class="actor">HONEY BUNNY</p>
		<p class="spoken">Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're gonna fuckin' die bad!</p>

		<p class="actor">YOLANDA</p>
		<p class="spoken">Okay, now let him go!</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool. When you yell at me, it makes me nervous. When I get nervous, I get scared. And when motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOLANDA</p>
		<p class="scene">(more conversational)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Just know: you hurt him, you die.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">That seems to be the situation. NowI don't want that and you don't want that and Ringo here don't want that. So let's see what we can do.</p>
		<p class="scene">(to Ringo)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now this is the situation. Normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken. But you happened to pull this shit while I'min a transitional period. I don't wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. But I'm afraid I can't give you the case. It don't belong to me. Besides, I went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass.</p>

		<p class="scene">(to Pumpkin)</p>

		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Which one is it?</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">It's the one that says Bad Motherfucker on it.</p>
		<p class="text">Pumpkin looks in the bag and - sure enough - there's a wallet with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's my bad motherfucker. Now open it up and take out the cash. How much is there?</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">About fifteen hundred dollars.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Put it in your pocket, it's yours. Now with the rest of them wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score.</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">You ain't gonna do a god damn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up. Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't hafta kill your ass. You read the Bible?</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Not regularly.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you." I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or it could be you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.</p>

		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's probably a good idea.</p>
		<p class="text">Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the briefcase.</p>
		<p class="text">Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes - wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts, swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics - walk out of the coffee shop together without saying a word.</p>
