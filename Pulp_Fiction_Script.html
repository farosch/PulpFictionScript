		<p class="location">INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING</p>
		<p class="text">A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and eating eggs.</p>
		<p class="text">Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're going out of style.</p>
		<p class="text">It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how old she is; everything she does contradicts something she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but -</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">- but you forget about it in a day or two -</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">- yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days ofme rememberin' have just begun.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">When you go on like this, you know what you sound like?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">You sound like a duck.</p>
		<p class="scene">(imitates a duck)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack. . .</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. Becausesince I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear mequack about how I'm never gonna do it again.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">After tonight.</p>
		<p class="text">The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there, back and forth.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="scene">(with a smile)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Correct. I got all tonight to quack.</p>
		<p class="text">A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.</p>
		<p class="actor">WAITRESS</p>
		<p class="spoken">Can I get anybody anymore coffee?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oh yes, thank you.</p>
		<p class="text">The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man lights up another cigarette.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm doin' fine.</p>
		<p class="text">The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his smoke.</p>
		<p class="text">The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee.</p>
		<p class="text">The Young Man goes right back into it.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as whenyou rob a bank. You take more of arisk. Banks are easier! Federalbanks aren't supposed to stop youanyway, during a robbery. They'reinsured, why should they care? Youdon't even need a gun in a federalbank. I heard about this guy, walkedinto a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phonesaid: "We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all yourmoney, we're gonna kill 'er. "</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Did it work?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about! Knucklehead walks i na bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don'tlift a fuckin' finger.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Did they hurt the little girl?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't know. There probably never was a little girl - the point of thestory isn't the little girl. Thepoint of the story is they robbedthe bank with a telephone.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">You wanna rob banks?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what webeen doin'.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">So you don't want to be a bank robber?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin'twenty.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">And no more liquor stores?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">What have we been talking about? Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Toomany foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they can'tfuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:"Empty out the register, " and theydon't know what it fuckin' means. They make it too personal. We keepon, one of those gook motherfuckers'gonna make us kill 'em.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm not gonna kill anybody.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in asituation where it's us of them. Andif it's not the gooks, it these oldJews who've owned the store forfifteen fuckin' generations. Ya gotGrandpa Irving sittin' behind thecounter with a fuckin' Magnum. Trywalkin' into one of those storeswith nothin' but a telephone, seehow far it gets you. Fuck it, forgetit, we're out of it.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, what else is there, day jobs?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="scene">(laughing)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Not this life.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well what then?</p>
		<p class="text">He calls to the Waitress.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Garcon! Coffee!</p>
		<p class="text">Then looks to his girl.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">This place.</p>
		<p class="text">The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.</p>
		<p class="actor">WAITRESS</p>
		<p class="scene">(snotty)</p>
		<p class="spoken">"Garcon" means boy.</p>
		<p class="text">She splits.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Here? It's a coffee shop.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">What's wrong with that? People never rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquorstores, gas stations, you get yourhead blown off stickin' up one ofthem. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="scene">(taking to idea)</p>
		<p class="spoken">I bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Correct. Just like banks, these places are insured. The managers don't givea fuck, they're just tryin' to getya out the door before you startpluggin' diners. Waitresses, forgetit, they ain't takin' a bullet forthe register. Busboys, some wetbackgettin' paid a dollar fifty a hourgonna really give a fuck you'restealin' from the owner. Customersare sittin' there with food in theirmouths, they don't know what's goin'on. One minute they're havin' a Denveromelet, next minute somebody'sstickin' a gun in their face.</p>
		<p class="text">The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man continues in a low voice.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">See, I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. 'Member all thosecustomers kept comin' in?</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Then you got the idea to take everybody's wallet.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Uh-huh.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">That was a good idea.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Thanks.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">We made more from the wallets then we did the register.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yes we did.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">A lot of people go to restaurants.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">A lot of wallets.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Pretty smart, huh?</p>
		<p class="text">The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new information.</p>
		<p class="text">She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's face.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Pretty smart.</p>
		<p class="scene">(into it)</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm ready, let's go, right here, right now.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Remember, same as before, you're crowd control, I handle the employees.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Got it.</p>
		<p class="text">They both take out their . 32-caliber pistols and lay them on the table. He looks at her and she back at him.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I love you, Pumpkin.</p>
		<p class="actor">YOUNG MAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">I love you, Honey Bunny.</p>
		<p class="text">And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.</p>
		<p class="actor">PUMPKIN</p>
		<p class="scene">(yelling to all)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Everybody be cool this is a robbery!</p>
		<p class="actor">HONEY BUNNY</p>

		<p class="location">INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) - MORNING</p>
		<p class="text">An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front seat are two young fellas - one white, one black - both wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">- Okay now, tell me about the hashbars?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">What so you want to know?</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, hash is legal there, right?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean youcan't walk into a restaurant, roll ajoint, and start puffin' away. You'reonly supposed to smoke in your homeor certain designated places.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Those are hash bars?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah, it breaks down like this: it'slegal to buy it, it's legal to ownit and, if you're the proprietor ofa hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, which doesn'treally matter 'cause - get a load ofthis - if the cops stop you, it'sillegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that thecops in Amsterdam don't have.</p>

		<p class="spoken">It's the little differences. A lottathe same shit we got here, they gotthere, but there they're a littledifferent.</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Examples?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beerin a movie theatre. And I don't meanin a paper cup either. They give youa glass of beer, like in a bar. InParis, you can buy beer atMacDonald's. Also, you know whatthey call a Quarter Pounder withCheese in Paris?</p>
		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">They don't call it a Quarter Pounderwith Cheese?</p>

		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">Le Big Mac. What do they call aWhopper?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>

		<p class="actor">JULES</p>
		<p class="spoken">What?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Mayonnaise.</p>

And they showthat one show to the people who pickthe shows, and on the strength ofthat one show, they decide if theywant to make more shows.

		<p class="text">EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S - NIGHT</p>
		<p class="text">In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over L. A. , giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book, Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and over prices that pay for all this bullshit.</p>
		<p class="text">But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's diners.</p>
		<p class="text">Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of view.</p>
		<p class="text">Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine. "</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">What the fuck is this place?</p>

		<p class="spoken">After you, kitty-cat.</p>
		<p class="location">INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S - NIGHT</p>
		<p class="text">Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint English pub. Posters from 50's A. I. P. movies are all over the wall</p>
		<p class="text">("ROCK ALL NIGHT, " "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL, " "ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTER, " and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s cars.</p>
		<p class="text">In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign on the wall states, "No shoes allowed. " Some wannabe beboppers (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or barefeet.</p>
		<p class="text">The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing appropriate costumes.</p>
		<p class="text">Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red '59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing you please me. "</p>

		<p class="text">Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a fool.</p>

		<p class="spoken">Thanks.</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Think nothing of it.</p>
		<p class="text">He begins rolling one for himself.</p>
		<p class="text">As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.</p>

Accordingto the show, she was the deadliestwoman in the world with a knife. Butbecause she grew up in a circus, shewas also something of an acrobat. She could do illusions, she was atrapeze artist - when you're keepingthe world safe from evil, you neverknow when being a trapeze artist'sgonna come in handy.

		<p class="spoken">At the time I was told, it seemedreasonable.</p>
		<p class="actor">MIA</p>
		<p class="spoken">Marsellus throwing Tony out of afour story window for giving me afoot massage seemed reasonable?</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, it seemed excessive. But thatdoesn't mean it didn't happen. Iheard Marsellus is very protectiveof you.</p>
		<p class="actor">MIA</p>
		<p class="spoken">A husband being protective of hiswife is one thing. A husband almostkilling another man for touching hiswife's feet is something else.</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">But did it happen?</p>
		<p class="actor">MIA</p>
		<p class="spoken">The only thing Antwan ever touchedof mine was my hand, when he shookit. I met Anwan once - at my wedding- then never again. The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossedTony Rocky Horror out of that windowexcept Marsellus and Tony RockyHorror. But when you scamps gettogether, you're worse than a sewingcircle.</p>

		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">Was than an uncomfortable silence?</p>
		<p class="actor">MIA</p>
		<p class="spoken">I don't know what that was.</p>
		<p class="scene">(pause)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Music and drinks!</p>
		<p class="text">Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.</p>
		<p class="actor">VINCENT</p>
		<p class="spoken">I'm gonna take a piss.</p>
		<p class="actor">MIA</p>
		<p class="spoken">That was a little bit more informationthan I needed to know, but go rightahead.</p>
		<p class="text">Vincent shuffles off to the john.</p>
		<p class="text">Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs and selects one: k. d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It feels good.</p>
		<p class="text">Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.</p>
		<p class="text">The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face.</p>

		<p class="text">We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. Slack-jawed.</p>

It was boughtby private Doughboy Ernie Coolidgethe day he set sail for Paris. Itwas your great-granddaddy's war watch, made by the first company to evermake wrist watches. You see, up untilthen, people just carried pocketwatches. Your great-granddaddy worethat watch every day he was in thewar. Then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great-</p>
		<p class="spoken">grandmother, took the watch off hiswrist and put it in an ol' coffeecan. And in that can it stayed 'tilyour grandfather Dane Coolidge wascalled upon by his country to gooverseas and fight the Germans onceagain. This time they called it WorldWar Two. Your great-granddaddy gaveit to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't asgood as his old man's. Your granddadwas a Marine and he was killed withall the other Marines at the battleof Wake Island. Your granddad wasfacing death and he knew it. None ofthose boys had any illusions aboutever leavin' that island alive. Sothree days before the Japanese tookthe island, your 22-year oldgrandfather asked a gunner on an AirForce transport named Winocki, a manhe had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who hehad never seen in the flesh, hisgold watch. Three days later, yourgrandfather was dead. But Winockikept his word. After the war wasover, he paid a visit to yourgrandmother, delivering to your infantfather, his Dad's gold watch. Thiswatch. This watch was on your Daddy'swrist when he was shot down overHanoi. He was captured and put in aVietnamese prison camp. Now he knewif the gooks ever saw the watch it'dbe confiscated. The way your Daddylooked at it, that watch was yourbirthright. And he'd be damned ifand slopeheads were gonna put theirgreasy yella hands on his boy'sbirthright. So he hid it in the oneplace he knew he could hide somethin'. His ass. Five long years, he worethis watch up his ass. Then when hedied of dysentery, he gave me thewatch. I hid with uncomfortable hunkof metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was senthome to my family. And now, littleman, I give the watch to you.</p>

		<p class="text">Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it.</p>
		<p class="location">INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">His apartment hasn't been touched.</p>
		<p class="text">He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look around. Obviously, no one is there.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator.</p>
		<p class="text">He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.</p>
		<p class="text">With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he goes to the bedroom.</p>
		<p class="text">His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment - neat, clean and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.</p>
		<p class="text">Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.</p>
		<p class="text">He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and puts them in the toaster.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.</p>
		<p class="text">What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="scene">(softly)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Holy shit.</p>
		<p class="text">He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines it.</p>
		<p class="text">Then. . . a toilet FLUSHES.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the kitchen. There is someone behind it.</p>
		<p class="text">Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not knowing what to do.</p>
		<p class="text">The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.</p>
		<p class="text">Vincent and Butch lock eyes.</p>
		<p class="text">Vincent freezes.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's direction.</p>
		<p class="text">Neither man opens his mouth.</p>
		<p class="text">Then. . . the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.</p>
		<p class="text">That's all the situation needed.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch's finger HITS the trigger.</p>
		<p class="text">MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.</p>
		<p class="text">Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets SIMULTANEOUSLY - LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom.</p>
		<p class="text">By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent is annihilated.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.</p>
		<p class="text">With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 back on the kitchen counter.</p>
		<p class="text">Then he exits the apartment, quickly.</p>
		<p class="text">EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the courtyard. . .</p>
		<p class="text">. . . comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street. . .</p>
		<p class="text">. . . goes through the alley. . .</p>
		<p class="text">. . . and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.</p>
		<p class="text">EXT. HONDA - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide smile of a survivor breaks across his face.</p>
		<p class="text">EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment building.</p>
		<p class="location">INT. HONDA - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">Butch looks out the window at his former home.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch. They keep underestimatin'ya.</p>
		<p class="text">This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he SINGS along with it.</p>
		<p class="text">He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see:</p>
		<p class="text">THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD</p>
		<p class="text">The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see Marsellus clearly.</p>
		<p class="text">Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him.</p>
		<p class="text">When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances to his left, sees Butch, continues walking. . . then STOPS!</p>
		<p class="text">DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"</p>
		<p class="text">Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. He STOMPS on the gas pedal.</p>
		<p class="text">The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on the sidewalk.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.</p>
		<p class="actor">PEDESTRIAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Jesus, are you okay?</p>
		<p class="text">Butch look at him, spaced-out.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">I guess.</p>
		<p class="text">Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS gather around the body.</p>
		<p class="actor">GAWKER #1</p>
		<p class="scene">(to the others)</p>
		<p class="spoken">He's dead! He's dead!</p>
		<p class="text">This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.</p>
		<p class="text">TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.</p>
		<p class="text">The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.</p>
		<p class="actor">GAWKER #2</p>
		<p class="spoken">If you need a witness in court, I'llbe glad to help. He was a drunkenmaniac. He hit you and crashed intothat car.</p>
		<p class="actor">MARSELLUS</p>
		<p class="scene">(still incoherent)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Who?</p>
		<p class="actor">GAWKER #2</p>
		<p class="scene">(pointing at Butch)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Him.</p>
		<p class="text">Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge down the street, looking a shambles.</p>
		<p class="actor">MARSELLUS</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, I'll be damned.</p>
		<p class="text">The big man takes out a . 45 Automatic and the Gawkers back away.</p>
		<p class="text">Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward him.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">Sacre bleu.</p>
		<p class="text">Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.</p>
		<p class="text">He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, screaming.</p>
		<p class="actor">LOOKY-LOO WOMAN</p>
		<p class="spoken">Oh my God, I've been shot!</p>
		<p class="text">That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.</p>
		<p class="text">Marsellus RUNS after him.</p>
		<p class="text">The CROWD looks agape.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.</p>
		<p class="text">The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".</p>
		<p class="location">INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of Butch RACES into his world.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Can I help you wit' somethin'?</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">Shut up!</p>
		<p class="text">Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next to the door.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now you just wait one goddamn minute-</p>
		<p class="text">Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist in Marsellus' face.</p>
		<p class="text">The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man FALLS FLAT on his back.</p>
		<p class="text">Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in the face.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold of his middle finger.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">So you like chasing people, huh?</p>
		<p class="text">He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound. Butch then places the barrel of the . 45 between his eyes, PULLS back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the splatter.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well guess what, big man, you caughtme -</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD (O. S. )</p>
		<p class="spoken">- hold it right there, godammit!</p>
		<p class="text">Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">Look mister, this ain't any of yourbusiness -</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">- I'm makin' it my business! Nowtoss that gun!</p>
		<p class="text">Butch does.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Now you on top, stand up and come tothe counter.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.</p>
		<p class="text">After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the counter and moves to the telephone.</p>
		<p class="text">Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Zed? It's Maynard. The spider justcaught a coupl'a flies.</p>
		<p class="text">Marsellus passes out.</p>
		<p class="annotation">FADE TO BLACK</p>
		<p class="annotation">FADE UP:</p>
		<p class="location">INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">TWO SHOT - BUTCH AND MARSELLUS</p>
		<p class="text">They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are unconscious.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two prisoners look up at their captors.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' . 45 sticking in his belt.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Nobody kills anybody in my place ofbusiness except me or Zed.</p>
		<p class="text">A BUZZER buzzes.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's Zed.</p>
		<p class="text">Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs that lead to red curtains and goes through them.</p>
		<p class="text">WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed inside the store.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what they've gotten themselves into.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a long time, then says:</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED</p>
		<p class="scene">(to Maynard)</p>
		<p class="spoken">You said you waited for me?</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">I did.</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED</p>
		<p class="spoken">Then how come they're all beat up?</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">They did that to each other. Theywas fightin' when they came in. Thisone was gonna shoot that one.</p>

		<p class="spoken">You were gonna shoot him?</p>
		<p class="text">Butch makes no reply.</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in frontof this place?</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED</p>
		<p class="spoken">No, it's Thursday.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Then she'll be fine.</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED</p>
		<p class="spoken">Bring out The Gimp.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">I think The Gimp's sleepin'.</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED</p>
		<p class="spoken">Well, I guess you'll just wake 'emup then, won't you?</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="scene">(yelling in the hole)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Wake up!</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a leash.</p>
		<p class="text">He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises THE GIMP.</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large dog.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, then backs away.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="scene">(to The Gimp)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Down!</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp gets on its knees.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Who's first?</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED</p>
		<p class="spoken">I ain't fer sure yet.</p>
		<p class="text">Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, miney, moe. . . " just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger going back and forth between the two.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch are Marsellus are terrified.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving left to right, then it stops.</p>
		<p class="text">TWO SHOT - BUTCH AND MARSELLUS</p>
		<p class="text">After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on Marsellus.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed stands up.</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED</p>
		<p class="spoken">Wanna do it here?</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Naw, drag big boy to Russell's oldroom.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old room.</p>
		<p class="text">Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty.</p>
		<p class="text">As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="scene">(to The Gimp)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Up!</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on the ceiling.</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD</p>
		<p class="spoken">Keep an eye on this one.</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp bows its head: "yes. " Maynard disappears into Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy.</p>
		<p class="text">From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD (O. S. )</p>
		<p class="spoken">Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fightin 'em!</p>
		<p class="text">We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.</p>
		<p class="actor">ZED (O. S. )</p>
		<p class="spoken">You wanna fight? You wanna fight?Good, I like to fight!</p>
		<p class="text">Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, hurriedly struggles to get free.</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp is laughing wildly.</p>
		<p class="text">The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:</p>
		<p class="actor">MAYNARD (O. S. )</p>
		<p class="spoken">That's it. . . that's it boy, you'regoin' fine. Oooooooh, just likethat. . . that's good.</p>
		<p class="scene">(grunting faster)</p>
		<p class="spoken">Stay still. . . stay still goddamn ya! Zed goddammit, git over here andhold 'em!</p>
		<p class="text">Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were never connected by a bolt.</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.</p>
		<p class="actor">THE GIMP</p>
		<p class="spoken">Huhng?</p>
		<p class="text">The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through the red curtains.</p>
		<p class="location">INT. PAWNSHOP - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">Butch sneaks to the door.</p>
		<p class="text">On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with Marsellus.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in with.</p>
		<p class="text">He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots what he's been looking for:</p>
		<p class="text">A Samurai sword.</p>
		<p class="text">It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears through the red curtains to take care of business.</p>
		<p class="location">INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.</p>
		<p class="text">Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.</p>
		<p class="location">INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM - DAY</p>
		<p class="text">Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched positions.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden horse.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up behind him with the sword.</p>
		<p class="text">Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">Hey hillbilly.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch SCREAMS. . . with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on Zed.</p>
		<p class="text">Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' . 45 Automatic, which lies within reach.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch's eyes follow Zed's.</p>
		<p class="actor">BUTCH</p>
		<p class="spoken">You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.</p>
		<p class="text">Zed studies Butch.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch looks hard at Zed.</p>
		<p class="text">Then a VOICE says:</p>
		<p class="actor">MARSELLUS (O. S. )</p>
		<p class="spoken">Step aside, Butch.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him, holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.</p>
		<p class="text">KABOOM! ! ! !</p>
		<p class="text">Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.</p>
		<p class="text">Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the used shotgun shell.</p>
		<p class="text">Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:</p>

		<p class="text">Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.

What you need to take care ofare the really messy parts. The poolsof blood that have collected, yougotta soak that shit up. But thewindows are a different story. Themyou really clean. Get the Windex, doa good job. Now Jimmie, we need toraid your linen closet. I needblankets, I need comforters, I needquilts, I need bedspreads. The thickerthe better, the darker the better. No whites, can't use 'em. We need tocamouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat andthe backseat and the floor boardswith quilts and blankets.

And Iwill strike down upon thee with greatvengeance and furious anger thosewho attempt to poison and destroy mybrothers. And you will know I am theLord when I lay my vengeance uponyou. " I been sayin' that shit foryears. And if you ever heard it, itmeant your ass. I never reallyquestioned what it meant. I thoughtit was just a coldblooded thing tosay to a motherfucker 'fore you poppeda cap in his ass. But I saw someshit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you'rethe evil man. And I'm the righteousman. And Mr. . 45 here, he's theshepherd protecting my righteous assin the valley of darkness. Or iscould by you're the righteous manand I'm the shepherd and it's theworld that's evil and selfish. I'dlike that. But that shit ain't thetruth. The truth is you're the weak.
